# VSTS build tasks

This repository will contain set of VSTS build tasks which I am using in day-to-day work.

## Build extension

I used this guide http://www.andrewhoefling.com/devops/2017/10/02/Dev-Ops-VSTS-Custom-Build-Task-Extension.html to create an extension.
In the end, it is just execution of command ```tfx extension create --manifest-globs vss-extension.json```
