# Azure Costs Saver

This package is designed to save on costs of resources in Azure. Usually, one is not using Test and Acceptance resources during nights and weekends, but not everybody can afford themselves to destroy those resources and recreate them (complex configurations, too much manual interventions, whateverYouNameIt).
So, I designed this small script for VSTS, which requires your connection to Azure RM and wants your resource group name to proceed.

If you select to downscale your resources (running at evening) - it will find all SQL databases, all web apps and all VMs belonging to given resource group and will downscale web apps and sql databases to lowest possible size, vm's will be deprovisioned. If you select to upscale resources - script will read tags on them and upscale resources (web app and sql databases), vm's will be started.
